# Ball-Simulator
Simple 2D Ball Bouncing Simulation in C.

Requires graphics.h header file for it to work. Since this file is very old and not in use anymore you will require to use IDEs like TurboC.
Alternatively you can use the text based output which is commented within the code but for that you will require to get rid of all the graphics based functions used.
